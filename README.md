# ESpec Package for Sublime Text 2/3

Based on the awesome [RSpec Package for Sublime Text 2/3](https://github.com/SublimeText/RSpec)

## Description

[ESpec](https://github.com/antonmi/espec) is a Behavior-Driven Development testing framework for Elixir.
ESpec is inspired by RSpec and the main idea is to be close to its perfect DSL.
This package adds support to Sublime Text 2 and 3 for specifying and testing Elixir applications with ESpec.
It contains extra syntax highlighting and many snippets.
